# Design Report

This report should be 1-2 pages long. The reason we are doing it is to get a basic idea of what the game should be like, which classes should the program have, which 
layers does it have etc...
Some info about this in the monday lecture, 23. okt, at ca. 1:17:00
We use markdown, pretty sure we can still include pictures.
It's ok if the game turns out differently than in the report

## Introduction
This software is developed by Group 27 (*pepsi gun*) as part of the Late-term assignment.
The name of the course is Software Engineering (SC-T-303-HUGB).
The software is a simple implementation of the popular game *Tic-Tac-Toe*.

## Classes
Maybe we can use the noun identification method
... probably not because we have no documentation to search for nouns in.

## Coding rules
These are the rules that group members will follow when writing code
Maybe we could use markdown lists for this section
