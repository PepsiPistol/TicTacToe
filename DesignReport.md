#Design Report
This report should be 1-2 pages long. The reason we are doing it is to get a basic idea of what the game should be like, which classes should the program have, which 
layers does it have etc...
Some info about this in the monday lecture, 23. okt, at ca. 1:17:00
We use markdown, pretty sure we can still include pictures.
It's ok if the game turns out differently than in the report
